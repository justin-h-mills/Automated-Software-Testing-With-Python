Learning project for automated software testing with Python

<br>

## **Description**

***

<br>

Learning project for automated software testing with Python using a simple app that creates a circle object with a given radius. This class object contains methods to calculate the area and circumference with the given radius. These methods were then used to implement a simple automated testing with the unittest module.

<br>

### **Technologies**

<br>

A list of technologies used within the project:
* [unittest - Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

<br>

### **Points of Interest**

<br>

**Rules for unittest:**

1. All the tests are written as the methods of a class, which must inherit from the class `unittest.TestCase`.

2. Name of each and every test method should start with "test" otherwise it's be skipped by the test runner.

3. We use the `assertEqual()` method, which is part of the Unit testing framework instead of the built-in `assert` keyword available in Python.
